# Regression Exercises
### Kwame Taylor, Codeup Darden Cohort

This is the repository where I will house my regression exercises.

## Setup

In order to run the code in this repository, you'll need:

1. An installation of python through anaconda
2. An 'env.py' file that defines the following variables:
  - 'user'
  - 'host'
  - 'password'

The code in here was developed on MacOS, but should run fine anywhere you can install python + anaconda.
